# 🐍 100 Days of Python Coding Challenge (Restarted)

Hi, I'm Priya! 👋  
Welcome to my clean and consistent restart of the **100 Days of Python** challenge. My goal is to learn one new concept every day and apply it through practical scripts.

## 📅 Start Date
📆 June 27, 2025

## ✅ Daily Progress



- ✅ Day 1: Welcome Message → [`day01_welcome_message.py`](day01_welcome_message.py)
- ✅ Day 2: Basic Math Operations (using user input) → [`day02_basic_math_operations.py`](day02_basic_math_operations.py)


## 🎯 Challenge Goals
- Learn and practice Python daily for 100 days
- Avoid repetition — one unique concept or skill per day
- Build a portfolio of scripts and mini-projects
- Use Git + GitHub to track and share progress

Let’s go, one line of code at a time! 💻🔥
